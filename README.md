# Ember-Orbit [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/orbitjs/ember-orbit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/orbitjs/ember-orbit) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/orbitjs/orbit.js](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/orbitjs/orbit.js?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Ember-Orbit is a library that integrates
[Orbit.js](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit) with
[Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) to provide flexibility and
control in your application's data layer.

Ember-Orbit features:

* Access to the full power of Orbit and its ecosystem, including compatible
  sources, buckets, and coordination strategies.

* A data schema that's declared through simple model definitions.

* Stores that wrap Orbit stores and provide access to their underlying data as
  easy to use records and record arrays. These stores can be forked, edited in
  isolation, and merged back to the original as a coalesced changeset.

* Live-updating filtered record arrays and model relationships.

* The full power of Orbit's composable query expressions.

* The ability to connect any number of sources together with Orbit coordination
  strategies.

* Orbit's git-like deterministic change tracking and history manipulation
  capabilities.

## Relationship to Orbit

Ember-Orbit provides a very thin "Emberified" layer over the top of some core
primitives from Orbit, including `Store`, `Cache`, and `Model` classes that
extend `Ember.Object`. Most common developer interactions with Orbit will be
through these classes.

However, Ember-Orbit does not attempt to wrap _every_ base class from Orbit.
For instance, you'll need to use Orbit's `Coordinator` and coordination
strategies to define relationships between Orbit sources. In this way, you can
install any Orbit `Source` or `Bucket` library and wire them together in your
Ember-Orbit application.

> **Important**: It's strongly recommended that you read the Orbit guides at
[orbitjs.com](http://orbitjs.com) before using Ember-Orbit, since an
understanding of Orbit is vital to making the most of Ember-Orbit.

## Status

Ember-Orbit obeys [semver](http://semver.org) and thus should not be considered
to have a stable API until 1.0. Until then, any breaking changes in APIs or
Orbit dependencies should be accompanied by a minor version bump of Ember-Orbit.

## Demo

[peeps-ember-orbit](https://github.com/cerebris/peeps-ember-orbit) is a simple
contact manager demo that uses Ember-Orbit to illustrate a number of
possible configurations and application patterns.

## Installation

As with any Ember addon, you can install Ember-Orbit in your project with:

```
ember install ember-orbit
```

Ember-Orbit depends on `ember-auto-import` to automatically import external
dependencies, including `@orbit/coordinator` and `@orbit/memory`.

If you want to use additional Orbit sources and buckets, install them as
regular dependencies. For example:

```
npm install @orbit/jsonapi --save
```

## Using Ember-Orbit

Ember-Orbit installs the following services by default:

* `dataCoordinator` - An `@orbit/coordinator` `Coordinator` instance that
  manages sources and coordination strategies between them.

* `store` - An Ember-Orbit `Store` instance.

Out-of-the box, you can begin developing using `store` service, which is
injected into every route and controller.

However, the store's contents exist only in memory and will be cleared every
time your app restarts. Let's try adding another source and use the
`dataCoordinator` service to keep it in sync with the store.

### Adding a "backup" source

Sources should be added to the `app/data-sources` directory.

Let's add an IndexedDB source that will serve as a backup. The factory that
generates this source should be defined in `app/data-sources/backup.js` as
follows:

```javascript
import IndexedDBSource from '@orbit/indexeddb';

export default {
  create(injections = {}) {
    injections.name = 'backup';
    injections.namespace = 'my-app';
    return new IndexedDBSource(injections);
  }
};
```

Note that `injections` should include both a `Schema` and a `KeyMap`, which
are created by default for every Ember-Orbit application. We're also adding
a `name` to uniquely identify the source within the coordinator as well as
a `namespace` that will be used to define the IndexedDB database.

Every source that's defined in `app/data-sources` will be discovered
automatically by Ember-Orbit and added to the `dataCoordinator` service.

Next let's define some strategies to synchronize data between sources.

### Defining coordination strategies

Coordination strategies should be added to the `app/data-strategies` directory.

Let's define a strategy to backup changes made to the store into our new
`backup` source. The factory that generates this strategy should be defined
in `app/data-strategies/store-backup.js` as follows:

```javascript
import { SyncStrategy } from '@orbit/coordinator';

export default {
  create() {
    // Backup all store changes (by making this strategy blocking we ensure that
    // the store can't change without the change also being backed up).
    return new SyncStrategy({
      source: 'memory',
      target: 'backup',
      blocking: true
    });
  }
};
```

You should also consider adding an event logging strategy to log events emitted
from your sources to the browser console. Let's add
`app/data-strategies/event-logging.js`:

```javascript
import { EventLoggingStrategy } from '@orbit/coordinator';

export default {
  create() {
    return new EventLoggingStrategy();
  }
};
```

Sources have another kind of log as well: a transform log, which tracks
transforms that are applied. A log truncation strategy will keep the size of
transform logs in check. It observes the sources associated with the strategy
and truncates their transform logs when a common transform has been applied
to them all. Let's add `app/data-strategies/log-truncation.js`:

```javascript
import {
  LogTruncationStrategy
} from '@orbit/coordinator';

export default {
  create() {
    return new LogTruncationStrategy();
  }
};
```

### Defining a data bucket

Data buckets should be added to the `app/data-buckets` directory.

Let's define a bucket to store state in IndexedDB. The factory that generates
this strategy should be defined in `app/data-buckets/main.js` as follows:

```javascript
import IndexedDBBucket from '@orbit/indexeddb-bucket';

export default {
  create() {
    return new IndexedDBBucket({ namespace: 'my-app-settings' });
  }
};
```

### Initializing our bucket

We need to ensure that the bucket defined above is injected into all the
sources in our application as well as the `KeyMap` for the application. We can
create a standard Ember initializer to do this - let's say
`app/initializers/orbit.js`:

```javascript
export function initialize(application) {
  application.inject('data-source', 'bucket', 'data-bucket:main');
  application.inject('data-key-map:main', 'bucket', 'data-bucket:main');
}

export default {
  name: 'orbit',
  initialize
};
```

### Activating the coordinator

Next we'll need to activate our coordinator as part of our app's boot process.
The coordinator requires an explicit activation step because the process is
async _and_ we may want to allow developers to do work beforehand.

In our case, we want to restore our store from the backup source before we
enable the coordinator. Let's do this in our application route's `beforeModel`
hook (in `app/routes/application.js`):

```javascript
const { get, inject, Route } = Ember;

export default Route.extend({
  dataCoordinator: inject.service(),

  beforeModel() {
    const coordinator = get(this, 'dataCoordinator');
    const backup = coordinator.getSource('backup');

    return backup.pull(q => q.findRecords())
      .then(transform => this.store.sync(transform))
      .then(() => coordinator.activate());
  }
});
```

This code first pulls all the records from backup and then syncs them
with the main store _before_ activating the coordinator. In this way, the
coordination strategy that backs up the store won't be enabled until after
the restore is complete.

### Defining models

Models are used to access the underlying data in an Ember-Orbit `Store`.
They provide a proxy to get and set attributes and relationships. In addition,
models are used to define the schema that's shared by the sources in your
Orbit application.

Define models in the `app/models` directory. Let's start with
`app/models/planet.js`:

```
import {
  Model,
  attr,
  key,
  hasMany
} from 'ember-orbit';

export default Model.extend({
  remoteId: key(),
  name: attr('string'),
  atmosphere: attr('boolean'),
  classification: attr('string'),
  moons: hasMany('moon', { inverse: 'planet' })
});
```

As well as `app/models/moon.js`:

```
import {
  Model,
  attr,
  key,
  hasOne
} from 'ember-orbit';

export default Model.extend({
  remoteId: key(),
  name: attr('string'),
  planet: hasOne('planet', { inverse: 'moons' })
});
```

> Note that we're using a `key` named `remoteId`. In addition to declaring the
`KeyMap`, this is required to maintain separate client-side and server-side
IDs (which is required for offline applications in which servers don't
accept client-generated IDs). It's beyond the scope of this README, but you'll
also need to specify these remote keys in the serializer used to communicate
with your backend.

### Adding records

Records can be added in a couple ways. The easiest is to use the `addRecord`
method on the store:

```javascript
store.addRecord({ type: 'planet', name: 'Earth' })
  .then(planet => {
    console.log(planet.get('name')); // Earth
  });
```

Alternatively, you can call `store.update()` and use the transform builder to
build up a single `Transform` with any number of operations:

```javascript
store.update(t => [
  t.addRecord({ type: 'planet', attributes: { name: 'Earth' } }),
  t.addRecord({ type: 'planet', attributes: { name: 'Venus' } })
])
  .then(() => {
    // planets added successfully in a single `Transform`
  });
```

> Note: calling `update` is a direct passthrough to the underlying Orbit store,
so it's important to specify records in their full normalized form
(see [the Orbit guides](http://orbitjs.com/v0.15/guide/modeling-data.html#Records)).

### Querying records

There are three unique methods used to query records:

* `store.query()` - returns a promise that resolves to a static recordset.

* `store.liveQuery()` - returns a promise that resolves to a live recordset that
  will be refreshed whenever the store's data changes.

* `store.cache.query()` - returns a static set of in-memory results immediately.

All of these query methods take the same arguments as any other queryable
Orbit source - see
[the Orbit guides](http://orbitjs.com/v0.15/guide/querying-data.html) for
details.

For example, the following `liveQuery` should return a promise that resolves
to a live resultset that will stay updated with the "terrestrial" planets in
the store:

```javascript
store.liveQuery(q => q.findRecords('planet')
                      .filter({ attribute: 'classification',
                                value: 'terrestrial' }));
```

Unlike the Orbit `Store`, in which results are returned as static POJOs,
results from Ember-Orbit queries are returned as records, i.e. instantiated
versions of their associated `Model` class.

The attributes and relationships of records will be kept in sync with the
backing store.

Note that the Ember-Orbit `Store` also supports the `find` method for
compatibility with Ember's default expectations in routes. The following
queries are async and call `store.query` internally:

```javascript
// find all records of a type
store.find('planet');

// find a specific record by type and id
store.find('planet', 'abc123');
```

The following queries are synchronous and call `store.cache.query` internally:

```javascript
// find all records of a type
store.cache.find('planet');

// find a specific record by type and id
store.cache.find('planet', 'abc123');
```

### Updating records

Any records retrieved from a store or its cache will stay sync'd with the
contents of that cache. Each attribute and relationship is a computed property
that has getters and setters which pass through to the underlying store.

Let's say that you find a couple records directly in the store's cache and
want to edit them:

```javascript
let jupiter = store.cache.find('planet', 'jupiter');
let io = store.cache.find('moon', 'io');
let europa = store.cache.find('moon', 'europa');
let sun = store.cache.find('star', 'theSun');

jupiter.set('name', 'JUPITER!');
jupiter.get('moons').pushObject(io);
jupiter.get('moons').removeObject(europa);
jupiter.set('sun', sun);
```

Behind the scenes, these changes each result in a call to `store.update`. Of
course, this method could also be called directly.

### Forking and merging stores

Because Ember-Orbit stores and caches are just thin wrappers over their
underlying Orbit equivalents, they share the same basic capabilities.
Thus, Ember-Orbit stores can be forked and merged, just as described in the
[Orbit guides](http://orbitjs.com/v0.15/guide/data-stores.html#Forking-stores).

The same example can be followed:

```javascript
// start by adding two planets and a moon to the store
store.update(t => [
  t.addRecord(earth),
  t.addRecord(venus),
  t.addRecord(theMoon)
])
  .then(() => store.query(q => q.findRecords('planet').sort('name')))
  .then(planets => {
    console.log('original planets');
    console.log(planets);

    // fork the store
    forkedStore = store.fork();

    // add a planet and moons to the fork
    return forkedStore.update(t => [
      t.addRecord(jupiter),
      t.addRecord(io),
      t.addRecord(europa)
    ]);
  })
  // query the planets in the forked store
  .then(() => forkedStore.query(q => q.findRecords('planet').sort('name')))
  .then(planets => {
    console.log('planets in fork');
    console.log(planets);
  })
  // merge the forked store back into the original store
  .then(() => store.merge(forkedStore)
  // query the planets in the original store
  .then(() => store.query(q => q.findRecords('planet').sort('name'))))
  .then(planets => {
    console.log('merged planets');
    console.log(planets);
  })
  .catch(e => {
    console.error(e);
  });
```

And the same notes apply:

* Once a store has been forked, the original and forked stores’ data can diverge
  independently.

* A store fork can simply be abandoned without cost.

* Merging a fork will gather the transforms applied since the fork point,
  coalesce the operations in those transforms into a single new transform, and
  then update the original store.

> **Important** - One additional concern to be aware of is that Ember-Orbit will
generate new records for each store. Care should be taken to not mix records
between stores, since the underlying data in each store can diverge. If you need
to access a record in a store's fork, just query the forked store or cache for
that record.
